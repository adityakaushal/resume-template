  An Engineering graduate in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently a Data Engineer whoâ€™s previously interned/worked at Hitachi as a Data Analyst Intern and Aerogram (IIT-Delhi Startup) as a Data Engineer Intern. I love coding and solving problems. My primary focus is on Data Engineering, Big Data Analytics, Cloud, and building solution with and related to data. Previously I finished up my B.Tech/B.E in Computer Science and Engineering  in Spring 2020, at Chandigarh University. My goals are to learn as much as possible from my experiences and interactions with others, and leave a positive impact on the world. I also love to write articles, blogs and to interact with people through my Podcast called Life, Tech and Beyond. Also, I like to help to build professional Resumes and SOPs for others. When I'm not working/programming I love to play chess and am also a keen camp fire level guitarist and an avid movie lover.
